# üê≥ Docker Overview

Docker was introduced to solve a classic developer problem:

> _"It works on my machine, but not on yours."_

Docker provides a way to package applications along with all their dependencies‚Äîsuch as libraries, binaries, and configuration files‚Äîinto a standardized unit called a **container**. These containers ensure consistency across **development**, **staging**, and **production** environments, making deployments more **reliable** and **reproducible**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Docker Architecture

Unlike traditional virtual machines that use a full **Guest Operating System**, Docker runs containers (such as **App1** and **App2**) directly on the **Host Operating System**.

This lightweight architecture enables:

- Better performance  
- Faster startup times  
- More efficient resource usage

## üîÑ Docker Workflow

- **Dockerfile**:  
  A text file containing step-by-step instructions to build a Docker image.

- **Docker Image**:  
  Built from the Dockerfile. It includes the complete application and environment setup.

- **Docker Hub**:  
  The Docker image can be pushed to **Docker Hub** (or a private registry) for distribution and storage.

- **Docker Container**:  
  A **running instance** of a Docker image.

### ‚úÖ Consistency in DevOps

In a typical DevOps workflow, the **same Docker image** is pulled from Docker Hub to both **staging** and **production** environments. This eliminates discrepancies caused by configuration differences or missing dependencies and ensures a **consistent application experience** across all environments.
